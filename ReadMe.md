# SISOP T1

Welcome to the SISOP T1 project! This README will guide you on how to set up and run the program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have `make` installed on your system.

### Running the Program

To compile and run the program, you have two options:

1. **Compile and run separately:**
    ```sh
    make
    ./t1_sisop
    ```

2. **Compile and run in one step:**
    ```sh
    make run
    ```

### Adding Test Cases

If you want to add other test cases, you should modify line 15 of the `cpu_scheduler.cpp` file.

```cpp
// Add your test cases here
```
